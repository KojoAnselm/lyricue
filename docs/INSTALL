               ****** Lyric Display System - Installation ******

For installation of LDS follow these 7 easy steps.
If you wish to upgrade follow this link or scroll past the installation section
1. Make sure you have mysql and perl installed
LDS is written in perl and holds all its data in two mysql databases so you
will require perl/mysql to be installed.
To download these go to http://www.perl.com and http://www.mysql.com or just
install them from your distributions install disks.
LDS also requires a few perl modules such as Gtk, DBI and Imlib. These may
already be installed or you can install them from CPAN or your install disks.
2. Download the main LDS program
LDS is available at http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/lds/download/lds-1.2.tar.gz
3. <Optional> Download the additional LDS backdrops
The additional backdrops are available at http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/lds/download/lds-backdrops-current.tar.bz2
4. Extract the files
To untar the main program run tar xvfj lds-1.2.tar.gz
If you downloaded the additional backdrops then change into the backgrounds
directory then untar the lds-backdrops-current.tar.bz2 file to there. This way
the install script will copy those files across at the same time as installing
everything else.
5. Run the install script
Change into the directory you just untared the main code into then run the
install script.
This script will check whether you have the nessecary dependancies then install
the program in /usr/bin with the shared components in /usr/share/lds
It may give an error message saying that certain DB's don't exist, just ignore
this message
6. Run the program
LDS was designed to run on two screens, with one being the interface, the other
being the actual display.
Normally the display screen should be hooked up to a projector for displaying
the lyrics to people so you may wish to run it from the other screen by using a
command such as DISPLAY=:0.1 lyric_server.pl which will run it on your second
screen
The interface can be run by typing lyric_interface.pl
note: You may wish to change lyric_server.pl to run at the correct size. By
default it runs at 800x600, to change this edit the two lines near the start of
lyric_server.pl that say WIDTH and HEIGHT to the size of your second screen/
projector
7. Enjoy

                ****** Lyric Display System - Upgrading ******
If you have a previous installation of LDS and wish to keep the songs/playlist
you already have follow the following instructions to upgrade your existing
installation
1. Download the LDS upgrade package
There is a special upgrade package which is a lot smaller since it does not
include the sql tables (i.e. the bible and example song db)
The package is available at http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/lds/download/lds-1.2-upgrade.tar.gz
3. Extract the files
To untar the upgrade run tar xvfz lds-1.2-upgrade.tar.gz
4. Run the upgrade script
Change into the directory you just untared the main code into then run the
upgrade script.
This script will check whether you have a previous installation and then
upgrade the program in /usr/bin with the shared components in /usr/share/lds
5. Go back to using LDS as before
None of the DB's have changed and the placement of files is the same so you can
go back to using LDS as you did before, only now with updated functionality/bug
fixes
