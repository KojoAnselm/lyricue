                            Lyricue - Installation

For installation of Lyricue follow these 7 easy steps.
If you wish to upgrade the process is exactly the same

0. Quick install if you are running Debian
If you are using debian add

deb http://www.adebenham.com/debian/ ./

to your /etc/apt/sources.list then install lyricue. You may then skip to step 5

1. Make sure you have mysql and perl installed
Lyricue is written in perl and holds all its data in two mysql databases so you
will require perl/mysql to be installed.
To download these go to http://www.perl.com and http://www.mysql.com or just
install them from your distributions install disks.
Lyricue also requires a few perl modules such as Gtk2 and DBI. These may
already be installed or you can install them from CPAN or your install disks.

2. Download the main Lyricue program
Lyricue is available at http://www.adebenham.com/lyricue/download/
lyricue-1.9.3.tar.bz2

3. Extract the files
To untar the main program run tar xvfj lyricue-1.9.3.tar.bz2

4. Install using make
Change into the directory you just untared the main code into then run make
install
This will install the program in /usr/bin with the shared components in /usr/
share/lyricue and default settings in /etc/lyricue

5. Run the program
LDS was designed to run on two screens, with one being the interface, the other
being the actual display.
Normally the display screen should be hooked up to a projector for displaying
the lyrics to people so you may wish to run it from the other screen by using a
command such as DISPLAY=:0.1 lyricue_server which will run it on your second
screen
The interface can be run by typing lyricue
note: You may wish to change lyricue_server to run at the correct size. By
default it runs at 1024 x 768, to change this edit your preferences in the
interface

6. Enjoy
