   For installation of Lyricue follow these 7 easy steps.
   If you wish to upgrade the process is exactly the same

   1. Make sure you have mysql and perl installed
   Lyricue is written in perl and holds all its data in two mysql databases so
   you will require perl/mysql to be installed.
   To download these go to [5]http://www.perl.com and [6]http://www.mysql.com
   or just install them from your distributions install disks.
   Lyricue also requires a few perl modules such as [7]Gtk2 and DBI. These may
   already be installed or you can install them from [8]CPAN or your install
   disks.

   2. Download the main Lyricue program
   Lyricue is available at
   [9]http://www.adebenham.com/lyricue/download/lyricue-1.9.tar.gz
   If you are upgrading you can download a smaller version (which doesn't
   have the bible database) from
   [10]http://www.adebenham.com/lyricue/download/lyricue-upgrade-1.9.tar.gz

   3. <Optional> Download the additional Lyricue backdrops
   The additional backdrops are available at
   [11]http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/lds/download/lds-backdrops-current.tar.bz2

   4. Extract the files
   To untar the main program run tar xvfj lyricue-1.9.tar.gz

   5. Run the install script
   Change into the directory you just untared the main code into then run the
   install script.
   This script will check whether you have the nessecary dependancies then
   install the program in /usr/bin with the shared components in
   /usr/share/lds and default settings in /etc/lds

   6. Run the program
   Lyricue was designed to run on two screens, with one being the interface, the
   other being the actual display.
   Normally the display screen should be hooked up to a projector for
   displaying the lyrics to people so you may wish to run it from the other
   screen by using a command such as DISPLAY=:0.1 lyricue_server which will
   run it on your second screen
   The interface can be run by typing lyricue
   note: You may wish to change ldss to run at the correct size. By default
   it runs at 640480, to change this edit your preferences in the interface

   7. Enjoy
