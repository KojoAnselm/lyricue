For installation detail see http://www.lyricue.org/documentation

For installation of Lyricue on non-debian based distributions follow these 4 easy steps.

Note: If you wish to upgrade the process is exactly the same

1. Make sure you have mysql and perl installed

Lyricue is written in perl and holds all its data in two mysql databases so you will require perl/mysql to be installed. To download these go to http://www.perl.com and http://www.mysql.com or just install them from your distributions install disks. Lyricue also requires a few perl modules such as Gtk2, Clutter and DBI.

These may already be installed or you can install them from CPAN or your install disks.

2. Download the main Lyricue program

Lyricue is available at http://www.lyricue.org/debian/lyricue_2.0.0.tar.gz

3. Extract the files

To extract the main program run: tar xvfz lyricue-2.0.0.tar.gz

4. Install using 'make'

Change into the directory you just untared the main code into then run: make install

This script will install the program in /usr/bin with the shared components in /usr/share/lyricue and default settings in /etc/lyricue
