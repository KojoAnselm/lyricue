Lyricue
-------

Introduction:
-------------

This is Lyricue.  It is a pair of perl applications that combine to create a way in which to display song lyrics on a screen for use in church etc.
It was created by Chris Debenham for Gosford Baptist Church.


There are two scripts, the first is 'lyricue' which is a interface to add/change/remove songs and to control the playlist. The second is 'lyricue_server' that displays lyrics or bible verses from the playlist.

Requirements:
-------------

Lyricue requires the following applications to be installed:
  MySQL version 3 or later
  Perl 5.004 or later

Lyricue requires the following Perl modules:
  DBI::MySql
  GTK2
  Gtk2::GladeXML
  Gnome2::Canvas

Installation:
-------------

Check file INSTALL in the docs directory for installation info

Running:
--------

To use Lyricue you need to have lyricue_server running on one screen and lyricue on the other screen.
A good idea is to put lyricue_server in your x-session startup so that it is always visble on the second screen. You may need to change its size
