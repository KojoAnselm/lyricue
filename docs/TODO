Things To Do - bugs/enhancements
--------------------------------
* Font colour changing doesn't apply until server restart?

* Colours/gradients for background

* multiple select for playlist (partialy done, backend exists)

* Global hotkeys - done, but gives error messages (ignorable)

* Possibly even line by line display within a song... (maybe best for 2.0)

* Import a presentation as a bunch of images, set backdrop to display each. Perhaps automatically convert from ppt file to list of jpegs?
