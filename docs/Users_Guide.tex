\section{Starting the Interface and Server}

Starting the interface way vary depending on how LDS has been setup.\\
A good idea is to place an icon on the desktop of your first screen
which when clicked runs  \emph{/usr/bin/lyric\_interface.pl }%
\footnote{default installation location, change if you installed it somewhere else
}\\
To load the server part just go to the Applications menu and chose
Lyric Server.


\section{The Main Interface}

to figure \ref{figure:interface} on page \pageref{figure:interface}.
