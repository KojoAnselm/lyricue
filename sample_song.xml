    <page>Amazing grace! 
How sweet the sound
that saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost but now am found, 
Was blind but now I see</page>
    <page>'Twas grace that taught 
my heart to fear,
and grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace 
appear the hour I first believed!</page>
    <page>Through many dangers, 
toils and snares I have 
already come;
'Tis grace hath brought 
me safe thus far, 
and grace will lead me home.</page>
    <page>When we've been there
ten thousand years,
bright shining as the sun,
We've no less days to 
sing God's praise 
then when we'd first begun.</page>
